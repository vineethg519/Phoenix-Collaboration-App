# Phoenix Collaboration
The collaboration tool is an innovative model that addresses these challenges, it supports messaging, where messages are sent directly to a person or to a group of people. All files, images, PDF's, documents and spreadsheets can be shared with everyone and stored in google drive by giving access permissions to team members. Group meetings can be scheduled in shared calendars. Sending notifications and reminders to team members about task deadlines and task progress. Team members can collectively edit documents using google docs API. Posting deadlines for the tasks so that an individual can track his/her performance and push notifications about the status of the task. The permissions will be assigned to different users based on their role in the organization which can be managed by the Administrator.
